# Random Password Generator

## Description

Our requirement for this assignment was to create a random password generator using user input in regard to if he/she wanted to use uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols and the amount of characters.

I did this by creating string variables for all the different options one can choose to make their password. Then by initialiazing prompts and confirms, the user would be able to customize what he/she would like to include for their password. By using conditional statements using the prompt and confirm variables, I was able to add the selected variables and add them to the empty possibleCharacter variable.

The, using Math.floor and Math.random, the function would generate a random password using the parameters that the user selected.
